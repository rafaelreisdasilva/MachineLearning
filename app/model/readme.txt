1. A well-structured pipeline that trains the property valuation model using the provided dataset, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.



2. An API that can receive property information and generate accurate valuation predictions.



3. A README file documenting the project, including instructions for running the pipeline and API, dependencies, and any assumptions or suggestions for improvement.


To improve the code for developing a model to estimate property valuations for an important real estate client in Chile, you can consider the following practices:

1. **Modularize the code**: Split the code into separate functions or classes to improve code organization, readability, and reusability. For example, you can create functions for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Use constants**: Instead of hard-coding values like column names and file paths, define them as constants to improve code maintainability and make it easier to update or modify.

3. **Handle missing values**: Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately. Depending on the extent of missing data, you can consider techniques such as imputation or exclusion of missing values.

4. **Data exploration and feature engineering**: Before training the model, perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights about the dataset. Consider feature engineering techniques such as creating new features, transforming variables, or encoding categorical variables in a more informative way.

5. **Feature scaling**: Depending on the algorithms used, feature scaling may be necessary to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training process. Consider scaling numerical features, such as using standardization or normalization techniques.

6. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Instead of using fixed hyperparameter values, consider performing hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model. Techniques like grid search or random search can be applied to explore different combinations of hyperparameters.

7. **Cross-validation**: Incorporate cross-validation during model training to obtain more robust performance estimates. This helps in evaluating the model's generalization ability and can guide hyperparameter tuning.

8. **Model selection**: Consider trying different models or algorithms to see if they provide better performance than the GradientBoostingRegressor. Compare and evaluate various models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

9. **Logging and documentation**: Implement logging to capture important information during model training and evaluation. Additionally, include documentation in the code to provide explanations and comments for better code understanding.

By incorporating these practices, you can enhance the code for developing the property valuation model in terms of code organization, data handling, feature engineering, model selection, and documentation.


depois de criar o dockerfile executar o comando  docker build -t prediction-chile .
com o ponto, isso cria a imagem
